Algorithms implemented:
<li>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</li>
<li>Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)</li>
<li>SCAN (Elevator)</li>
<li>C-SCAN (Circular Elevator)</li>
</ul><br>
Input data is generated randomly during runtime. All algorithms work with the same data.<br>
Quantity of tests is determined by user prompt during runtime.<br>
By the result of the tests, the fastest algorithm is <b>SCAN (Elevator)</b>.
