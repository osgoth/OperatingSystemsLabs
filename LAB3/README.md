<ul>
Algorithms implemented:
<li>First In First Out (FIFO)</li>
<li>Optimal Page Replacement (OPT)</li>
<li>Least Recently Used (LRU)</li>
<li>Second Chance (ALRU)</li>
</ul><br>
Input data is generated randomly during runtime. All algorithms work with the same data.<br>
Quantity of tests is determined by user prompt during runtime.<br>
By the result of the tests, the fastest algorithm is <b>Optimal Page Replacement (OPT)</b>.
