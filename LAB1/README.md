Algorithms implemented:
<li>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</li>
<li>Shortest Job First (SJF)</li>
<li>Shortest Remaining Time First (prremptive SJF/SRTF)</li>
<li>Round Robin (RR)</li>
</ul><br>
Input data is generated randomly during runtime. All algorithms work with the same data.<br>
Quantity of tests is determined by user prompt during runtime.<br>
By the result of the tests, the fastest algorithm is <b>SRTF</b>.
